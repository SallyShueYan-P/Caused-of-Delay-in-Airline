# Caused-of-Delay-in-Airline
This project employs machine learning techniques such as PCA, MLR, and KNN to determine key factors predicting flight delays. Delays are a significant problem in air transport, impacting both costs and passenger satisfaction. The study examines the Airline Delay Caused dataset, analyzing its properties and features to identify underlying structures and complexities. By utilizing PCA, MLR, and KNN, we compare their effectiveness in reducing the dataset and determining predictive factors. Notably, security_ct has minimal impact on delays, while multiple linear regression achieves 100% prediction accuracy. These findings enable the USA's aviation industry to concentrate on improving elements that affect arrival flight durations, leading to enhanced efficiency and customer experience.

Through analysis and comparison of the outputs obtained from PCA, MLR, and KNN, this project offers insights into strategies that can help airlines address flight delays. By exploring the relationships between various independent variables and flight delays, the study contributes to a deeper understanding of the factors influencing delay occurrences. The findings demonstrate that multiple linear regression provides accurate predictions in this case, indicating that independent variables play a crucial role in determining delay durations. The research outcomes empower the aviation industry to focus on improving the identified elements, ultimately enhancing the overall efficiency and punctuality of arriving flights in the USA.
